# Clemson_Project_Realtime-Face-Emotion-Recognition-Tensorflow-Transfer-Learning-Python

This paper presented the development of Real-Time emotion recognition using deep learning with 
Google Colab, Tensorflow, OpenCV, Dlib. The success of this approach in recognizing emotions has been tremendously improving over 
time. Introducing deep learning techniques like CNN, DNN, or other multimodal methods has also boosted 
the pace of recognition accuracy. Our work demonstrated the general architectural model for building 
a recognition system using deep learning (CNN). The aim was to analyze pre and post processes 
involved in the model's methodology. There is extensive work done on image or video as input (Real-Time System) 
to recognize the emotion. This paper also covered the datasets available for the researchers to contribute to this 
field. Different performance parameters were benchmarked on different research to show this 
sphere's progress. The experimental observation was carried out on the Kaggle  dataset involving seven emotions, namely 
angry, disgust, fear, happy, sad, surprise, neutral, which yielded in the be 0.97 accuracies on the training set and 
0.574 accuracy on the testing set when the Haar cascade technique is applied.
